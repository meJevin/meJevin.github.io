              I'm only in the beginning of my programming carrier, but already
              have a strong knowledge base of programming lanuages, frameworks,
              APIs & general computer architecture on different levels; starting
              from CPU registers and finishing with high-level software
              abstractions.

              <br /><br />
              Among the tools I've used are:

              I'm extremly enthusiastic to any kind of programming experience,
              because I truly enjoy what I do. Whether it be a web-site, mobile
              app, desktop app, a simple CLI tool or anything of that sort. That
              is why I'm open to any offers you throw at me. And being a
              dedicated, hard-working person that I am, I usually yield great
              results. I always try to stay on the bleeding edge of the modern
              programming world, learning new things, improving my knowledge in
              areas that I already know.

          <p>
            I've worked as a programming teacher for a little while. I was
            giving courses on <span class="highlight">C#</span> and
            <span class="highlight">Unity</span> to kids and teens from 10 years
            all the way up to 18 years old. I was the youngest teacher in the
            company at the time, but I was doing really well and taught a lot of
            people new things. Because I was so young my students really liked
            me and were really into the topics I taught. Would say that I
            acquired a lot of knowledge there related to programming. But if was
            a cool experience teaching people things that I love to play around
            with
